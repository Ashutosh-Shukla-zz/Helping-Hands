# Helping-Hands

There’s a lot of help needed to make the world a better place. This currently is being done by a lot of entities (corporates, NGO’s & individuals). To help the one’s who are in need these entities step up and take the responsibility. This takes a lot of time and effort and there Is a very minimum return on this effort. There is a huge gap between the resources being offered and where it is needed. Also, the way this framework is implemented and used is ad hoc and inefficient.  
### Objective:

Our application will consolidate all the voluntary resources (Food, shelter, education, healthcare and volunteers).
